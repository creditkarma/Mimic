## Reporting a bug

Mimic uses github issues to track bugs. Bugs are labelled as [bug](../../labels/bug).
Before reporting a new bug first search the issues to find out if it's already reported and/or resolved and pending merge.

When you create a new bug report please include following information:

* Short description
* Environment on which you are able to reproduce it
* Steps to reproduce

## Feature requests

Feature requests are labelled as [enhancement](../../labels/enhancement). 
We welcome new feature requests but first find out if a similar request is already in the queue.

## Pull requests (bug fix, features, etc)

We welcome community contribution and help improving Mimic. Please keep your PRs focused to the scope.

All PRs will be reviewed by a core team who maintains Mimic project.
The core team will decide a PR should be merged to master and released as a patch, minor or major version.
